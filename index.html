          BuildBro was one of my first Scala projects that I used to help teach
          myself the language. I'm a huge fan of Scheme, so I thought I'd base
          the build language on that. So in addition to having some sweet syntax,
          you can use simple <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/buildbro/blob/master/README.md#macros">macros</a>
          to eliminate repetitive sections of your build definition. Notable parts of the
          implementation include a concise <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/buildbro/blob/master/src/main/scala/ExpReader.scala">parser</a>
          using Scala's built-in DSL, quasiquotation <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/buildbro/blob/master/src/main/scala/Evaluator.scala#L24">using the visitor pattern</a>,
          a <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/buildbro/blob/master/src/main/scala/Project.scala#L17">recursive dependency resolution algorithm</a>,
          and a very clean <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/buildbro/blob/master/src/main/scala/BuildBro.scala#L26">main method</a>.

        <div class="description">
          Headsheet was born out of my desire to use this crazy Haskell combinator called <tt>loeb</tt>:
          <pre>
loeb :: Functor f =&gt; f (f a -&gt; a) -&gt; f a
loeb x = fmap ($ loeb x) x -- Where the magic happens
          </pre>
          <tt>loeb</tt> basically acts as a "spreadsheet function". In the list case
          (it works for any <tt>Functor</tt>) you pass it a list
          of functions of type <tt>[a] -&gt; a</tt> and it returns a result of type
          <tt>[a]</tt>. The crazy thing is that the <tt>[a]</tt> passed to the
          functions is actually the "evaluated" list itself! You'd think this would
          result in infinite recursion, but Haskell's lazy evaluation performs a type
          of dependency management that evaluates everything in the right order.
          Here are a few examples using <tt>loeb</tt>:
          <pre>
Prelude Data.List&gt; loeb [\xs -&gt; xs !! 1 + 3, const 2]
[5,2]
Prelude Data.List&gt; loeb [const "hello ", \xs -&gt; xs !! 0 ++ "world"] !! 1
"hello world"
          </pre>
          As you can see in the screenshot, the expression language for the (web-based)
          spreadsheet is Haskell itself. The way Headsheet works is by constructing
          functions for each cell that call the Haskell interpreter on the contents
          of that cell -- these functions take an <tt>Array</tt> and return the
          result of evaluating that cell (by, for example, indexing into that array
          and manipulating other values in the spreadsheet). Other interesting parts
          of the implementation include <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/headsheet/blob/master/Main.hs#L101">a mini web framework</a> based on <tt>Network.HTTP.Server</tt>
          that handles routing and some ugly <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/headsheet/blob/master/Main.hs#L68">use of <tt>unsafePerformIO</tt></a>.

          Spaceman (short for "space manager") associates labels with points in space
          and allows you to retrieve all of the points in a specified area, as well
          as delete points by label. That's it. I wrote it for another project
          (location-based bulletin boards) so that we could cache locations and
          retrieve them over areas very quickly (not that we needed this kind of
          scalability, but writing Spaceman was fun). You interact with Spaceman
          over TCP, by sending simple plaintext commands. The implementation includes
          an immutable and expandable <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/spaceman/blob/master/Quadtree.hs">quadtree</a>, QuickCheck <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/spaceman/blob/master/QuadtreeTests.hs">tests</a>
          for said quadtree (love me some QuickCheck), and a Parsec <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/spaceman/blob/master/Spaceman.hs#L50">parser</a>
          for the command language.

          Privy was built with my friend <a href="https://github.com/hsc">hsc</a> using Django. It allows you to create
          circular location-based anonymous bulletin boards. The idea is that
          you can make a bulletin board for your house, your school, or even
          your city by creating a circle around that area -- and then "share
          the world's secrets". The implementation is pretty complete, and I
          even ran an instance for a while for my friends, but its abandoned
          at this point.

          Truthity is a somewhat-unfinished project of mine that I started to learn
          the Play for Scala framework. The idea was that you could submit facts
          in subject-verb-object form, and then vote on them to create "truth
          by consensus". Its a bit of a joke related to how Wikipedia works. I
          actually <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/truthity/blob/master/app/controllers.scala#L60">like</a> Anorm, the DB access layer for Play.
          The way it uses parser combinators to parse result rows is pretty sick,
          if somewhat undocumented.

          <p>
            Distributed systems was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken,
            under <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tom/">Tom Anderson</a>.
            My partner was the immensely talented <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/">Colin Scott</a>, now a grad student at UC Berkeley.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our class-long project, we built a distributed cache-coherent filesystem.
            That means files can be stored across multiple nodes consistently, with
            transactional writes and reads. We implemented multi-paxos, which allowed
            our system to decide upon an order for transactions as they were submitted.
            We also implemented a reliable in-order transport protocol from scratch
            that would preserve sequence numbers across node restarts. Everything
            ran inside a simulator (that could simulate packet drops and reorderings
          and such) provided by the instructor. We also used Google protobuffers for our upper layer protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our proudest detail of the code is
            the elegant use of abstractions to control complexity. For example,
            we had a class called a <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/primitives/Handle.java"><tt>Handle</tt></a> that essentially
            acted as a future so we could handle asynchronous operations easily.
            We also implemented a <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/primitives/Lock.java">lock</a> to operate within the context of the simulator.
            We built a <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/transactions/ServerState.java">state machine</a> to handle the complex state of
            the transaction server. One of the most complicated parts of the code
            is the <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/tree/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos">multi-paxos implementation</a>. We structured the code so that agents could
            have many (generic) <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos/PaxosRole.java">roles</a>: <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos/Learner.java">learner</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos/Monitor.java">monitor</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos/Acceptor.java">acceptor</a> -- corresponding to the roles described in the original paper. Messages to each agent were dispatched to the appropriate role using a <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos/Role.java#L166">demultiplexer</a> operating according to rules in a <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/paxos/Role.java#L126">dispatch table</a>. Throughout the project, we used
            a python script I wrote to compare relative line counts for each file.
            If a file got too long (comparatively), we tried to refactor it.
            <p>
              Another useful bit was an advanced <a href="https://github.com/wcauchois/cse490h/blob/master/p2pfb/proj/debug/PacketDisplayer.java">packet tracing framework</a> that allowed us to view the packets (in glorious color) as they were transmitted.

          This was a Python binding to a support vector machine library called SVM-Light. Even though I don't maintain it very well, it appears to be in use by a few people in academia -- I get an email or a bug report every once in a while. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
